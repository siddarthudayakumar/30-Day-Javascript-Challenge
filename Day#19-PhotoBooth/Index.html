	<!--Okay, this project was challenging to me. I had to rely completely on the video for the JS. It might be slightly different but more or less 
		a step-by-step procedure of what was in the video since I followed it to the point.-->
	<!--Package.JSON contains dependency for a localhost secure server that allows the WebCam to be accessed.-->
