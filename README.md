# 30-Day-Javascript-Challenge
My Daily progress for the 30 Day Javascript Challenge from Wes Bos.

* I intend to create a simple Javascript stuff from the challenge using new stuff picked up from the challenge and using stuff familiar to
  me. I will update this ReadMe file with what I have built for that day and my progress.
  
  * Day #1 (1/16/17) - A simple JS Basskit. 
  * Day #2 (1/17/17) - A simple JS and CSS based clock with animations. 
  * Day #3 (1/18/17) - A simple web page modifying CSS variables with JS.
  
  --Update-- 
  I have changed the Folder names so that they do not have spaces. This allows the HTML and CSS files to be easily accessed through modern browsers
  --Update--
  
  * Day #4 (1/19/17) - A simple project that deals with Array manipulation using Javascript. Not a lot of CSS work here.
  * Day #5 (1/20/17) - A web page that explores the Flex property in CSS. As a comics fan, I made something for The Avengers with minimalist posters from the Web.
                       Got to create a similar one for The justice League.
  * Day #5.1 (1/21/17) - I did say I would create a similar one for The Justice League and I created it. This one is based off the Timm-Verse. Overflow Probem persists.
                         Might have to edit it out. 
  * Day #6 (1/23/17) - A simple Search demo using JS and Regular Expressions with AJAX. Might reformat this a bit. 
  * Day #7 (1/24/17) - A simple project that deals with Array manipulation using Javascript. Not a lot of CSS work here. Part II of the earlier Day #4 project.
  * Day #8 (1/25/17) - A Simple HTML Canvas with draw function using JS. 
  * Day #9 (1/26/17) - A simple HTML page with nifty console commands. Ignore lame joke in console. 
  * Day #10 (1/27/17) - A static Checkbox/To Do list with multiple selections using Javascript.
  * Day #11 (1/30/17) - A custom HTML 5 video player with pretty heavy CSS code. I had to follow the tutorial resource for the CSS. 
  * Day #12 (1/31/17) - A simple web page which uses a Konami code like implementation to show easter eggs using JS. 
  * Day #13 (2/1/17) - A web page which showcases a slide in image animation. I created it like a travel blog. Pictures used are my own photos from my travels.
  * Day #14 (2/2/17) - A simple page with console logs to show the difference between reference and copy in Javascript.
  * Day #15 (2/3/17) - A Checklist Web page that showcases localStorage and How to delegate tasks.
