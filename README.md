# 30-Day-Javascript-Challenge
My Daily progress for the 30 Day Javascript Challenge from Wes Bos.

* I intend to create a simple Javascript stuff from the challenge using new stuff picked up from the challenge and using stuff familiar to
  me. I will update this ReadMe file with what I have built for that day and my progress.
  
  * Day #1 (1/16/17) - A simple JS Basskit. 
  * Day #2 (1/17/17) - A simple JS and CSS based clock with animations.
